# simpleAsCouldBe.github.io

## TODO

* Build this like an index page. Search all github repos for ones that have a `gh-pages` branch and just build a list of links to them. Maybe show name/description while at it. Apis like this make it easy: `https://api.github.com/repos/SimpleAsCouldBe/gameOfLife/branches/gh-pages`
