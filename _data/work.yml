    * App: collaborative spreadsheet-style management tool for over 200k investable entities
    * Team: designer, 2 front-end, 2 back-end
    * Advocated for a `Angular`+`SlickGrid` UI stack by demonstrating smooth interaction on the full data set
    * Built a fast solution to smoothly resize spreadsheet columns to fit text as you scroll
    * Built a tree-based file system UI where `1-n` leaves may be added, removed, and arbitrarily ordered
    * Designed and implemented a cached-busted, automatically tested deployment with `Jenkins`, `Grunt`, `s3`, `CloudFront`, and `Karma/Jasmine`
