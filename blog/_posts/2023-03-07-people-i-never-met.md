You've probably had the experience of having your life positively impacted by someone you've never met.

It blows me away sometimes how sticky some ideas can be, and I thought it'd be an interesting exercise to list them out intentionally.

So what follows is a list of people I have never met, but have substantially impacted my life in one way or another.

I'm grateful to them, and to each, I want to say a sincere "thank you".

Here are the ideas I carry with me:

[Mr Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)
* **E-Biking**: Inspiration and instructions for the "badass DIY electric bike" I [built](https://www.simple.gy/blog/ebike/) and have ridden to work every day for years
* **Financial Independence**: A way of thinking about (and explaining to others) frugality and investing

[Tynan](https://tynan.com/)
* **Work Travel Idea**: Planted a seed that long term laptop-based work travel is possible
* **Vans**: The idea that living in an RV or van was something you could do if you wanted to. I ended up with 2 [vans](https://downbytheriver.us/) and an RV because of this.
* **Travel philosophy**: only one bag, "quick drying" is an important feature of clothes, and that merino wool clothes are the best
* **Gear / BIFL thinking**: Specifically, [Buffs](https://www.google.com/search?q=wool+buff) -- amazing, versatile, weird

[levels.io](https://levels.io/blog/)
* **Work Travel, Push**: The practical push (via [NomadList.com](https://nomadlist.com/)) to actually go to Thailand/Vietnam/Bali/Budapest.

[Rands](https://randsinrepose.com/)
* **Leadership**: The first leadership/management I ever read, and still one of my favorites. [Managing Humans](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484271157) shaped my way of thinking about my team and being a manager.

[Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/)
* **Serious Web Apps**: I wish I could find the original article, I think it's gone now, but I remember reading about using Backbone and just getting the clearest picture about how to restructure our whole app at the time from... well from no structure at all into something with an intentional vision. Now, probably, it's obvious you'd treat JS as a real application, but at the time, for me, it was a revelation. I would credit him with setting my technical career on a good path.

[Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/)
* **Structured Design Thinking**: [Web Form Design](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Form-Design-Filling-Blanks/dp/1933820241) was the first design book that ever really seemed objective and scientific to me. It's all about first-principles tradeoffs and using the right visual solution for the right thing, and that has stuck with me I hope forever. The section on form field label alignment I can still picture, from years ago, it's a classic for me.

To each of these people, *thank you*.
