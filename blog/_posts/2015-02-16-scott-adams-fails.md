## The One-Page Summary in Quotes

### Don't Trust Experts (Including Me)

> When it comes to any big or complicated question, humility is the only sensible point of view.

> my best guess is that experts are right about 98 percent of the time on the easy stuff but only right 50 percent of the time on anything that is unusually complicated, mysterious, or even new.

### Try Lots of Things

> I wanted to create, invent, write, or otherwise concoct something widely desired that would be easy to reproduce.

> see the world as a slot machine that doesn't ask you to put money in. All it asks is your time, focus, and energy.

> Systems people [feel] good every time they apply their system.

> When it comes to skills, quantity often beats quality... Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success... You're better off being good at two complementary skills than being excellent at one.

### Develop a Good Attitude

> You do better work, and you more enjoy life, when your attitude is good... Understand your basic nature as a moist robot that can be programmed for happiness if you understand the user interface.

> Smiling makes you feel better even if your smile is fake. This is the clearest example of how your brain has a user interface.

> if you have a big, interesting project in the works, you're a winner every time you wake up.

> happiness tends to happen naturally whenever you have good health, resources, and a flexible schedule... [it] has more to do with where you're heading than where you are.

## About Advice, Opinions, and Experts

He starts off with some ideas about how to evaluate the advice of others, including himself, and has some healthy, introspective caution about setting himself up as an expert. 

> You're the best judge of what works for you, as long as you acquire that wisdom through pattern recognition, trial, and observation.

> Most people think they have perfectly good bullshit detectors. But if that were the case, trial juries would always be unanimous, and we'd all have the same religious beliefs.

> Consider the people who routinely disagree with you. See how confident they look while being dead wrong? That's exactly how you look to them.

> When it comes to any big or complicated question, humility is the only sensible point of view.

> We know the brain creates illusions because there are so many competing religions in the world.

Includes some appropriate self-depreciating humor that works well.

> the only real difference between crazy people and artists is that artists write down what they imagine seeing.

Describes some of his successful friends:

> His biggest problem in life is that he keeps trading his boat for a larger one, and that's a lot of work.

> Sometimes you just need a friend who knows different things than you do. And you can always find one of those.

He learned not to take advice from others too much:

> This is when I learned that one should not seek life-altering advice from a kid named Peter whose primary credentials were that he once lived in a suburb or maybe a city.

And life taught him experts weren't that good for advice either:

> I got into college without much help from my guidance counselor, and I stayed in school against my doctor's advice. This was about the time that my opinion of experts, and authority figures in general, began a steady descent that continues to this day.

> my best guess is that experts are right about 98 percent of the time on the easy stuff but only right 50 percent of the time on anything that is unusually complicated, mysterious, or even new.

> If your gut feeling (intuition) disagrees with the experts, take that seriously. You might be experiencing some pattern recognition that you can't yet verbalize.





## His Personal Approach

Just like me, lived in upstate New York and moved to California:

> The experience of nearly dying in the frozen tundra of upstate New York inspired me to move to California.

> [The] one-way plane ticket to the vibrant economy and easy climate of northern California... was the smartest decision I ever made.

He describes his personal approach. That his job is to create the most concise form of an idea:

> I am a professional simplifier.

He kept trying things.

> I felt myself growing more capable every day, no matter the fate of the project I happened to be working on.

> I wanted to create, invent, write, or otherwise concoct something widely desired that would be easy to reproduce.

This was his filter for deciding where to spend his time:

> The world offers so many alternatives that you need a quick filter to eliminate some options and pay attention to others.

Believes in execution:

> The market rewards execution, not ideas.

Doesn't believe in the "find your passion" kind of passion:

> objectively, my passion level moved with my success.

Believes it will cost ya:

> If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it.

Debunking "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger":

> Becoming stronger is obviously a good thing, but it's only barely optimistic.

## Luck and Timing

Believes success is in large part timing:

> timing is often the biggest component of success.

And finds it self-evident that timing is mostly luck.

> I pursued a conscious strategy of managing my opportunities in a way that would make it easier for luck to find me.

> generating lots of opportunities for luck to find me and taking the sort of risks that will allow me to come out ahead even if the project fails.

> You can't directly control luck, but you can move from a game with low odds of success to a game with better odds.

> The hard part is figuring out the odds of any given game, and that's harder than it looks.

> it helps to see the world as math and not magic.

> Don't stop looking just because you don't see the pattern in the first seven years.


## Goals (or why Systems are Better)

> Goal-oriented people exist in a state of continuous presuccess failure

He makes the point that if you set a goal, you are a failure until you achieve it and are afterwards bored and/or directionless.

> ...enjoying the spoils of your success until they bore you, or set new goals and reenter the cycle of permanent presuccess failure.

> systems people are feeling good every time they apply their system. That's a big difference in terms of maintaining your personal energy in the right direction.






## Humor

> given a choice between saying what's true and saying what's funny, I'll take the path with the greatest entertainment value.

> before the age of laptops, when "portable" meant that an adult with good upper-body strength could lift it.

> Apparently the government expected its employees to resist armed robberies by reaching for their pieces and blazing away. Those were different times.

> there is no such thing as useful information that comes from a company's management.

## Fart Humor, Specifically

> fart so hard your intestines formed a tail.

> fart so hard that it inflates your socks












## Corporate America

He has a healthy distrust of the ability of corporate america to identify and reward talented employees that is borne of experience:

> looking good on paper was my best skill.

> I might be able to interview my way to some sort of senior executive position in which no one would notice I was totally skill free.

> the universe makes sure there isn't much of a link between job performance in the corporate world and outcomes.

> Most of my budget spreadsheets had formula errors, but that didn't matter because all of the inputs from the various departments were complete lies and bullshit. (0)

## Selfishness

Has some very unexpected, very considerate thoughts on greed in capitalism and selfishness.

> During your journey to success you will find yourself continually trying to balance your own needs with the needs of others. You will always wonder if you are being too selfish or not selfish enough.

> when it comes to the topic of generosity, there are three kinds of people in the world: Selfish, Stupid, or  Burden on others.

> Society hopes you will handle your selfishness with some grace and compassion. If you do selfishness right, you automatically become a net benefit to society.

> My best estimate is that I will personally consume about 10 percent of the total wealth I create over my career.

> Selfish successful people can be fun company if they've squirreled away all they need.

> If you neglect your health or your career, you slip into the second category--stupid--which is a short slide to becoming a burden on society.

> Being selfish doesn't mean being a sociopath. It just means you take the long view of things.

> when I started making more money than I would ever spend is that it automatically changed my priorities. I could afford any car I wanted, but suddenly I didn't care so much about my possessions beyond the utility they provided.

> humans are wired to take care of their own needs first, then family, tribe, country, and the world, roughly in that order.

> If you pursue your selfish objectives, and you do it well, someday your focus will turn outward.

> by becoming a person with good energy, you lift the people around you. That positive change will improve your social life, your love life, your family life, and your career.

> capitalism channels selfishness in a direction that benefits civilization

## Flexible Schedules

> At 6:00 A.M. I'm a creator, and by 2:00 P.M. I'm a copier.

Mr. Adams is a morning person because he's found he's more creative at that time.

> You can accomplish more by the time other people wake up than most people accomplish all day.

## Simplification

A career as a cartoonist makes one a natural simplifier, and Mr. Adams has identified this.

Simple in information design/marketing/communication:

> If the situation involves communication with others, simplification is almost always the right answer.

Simple in planning:

> If you can't tell whether a simple plan or a complicated one will be the best, choose the simple one.

> Simplifying is generally the strategy of people who view the world in terms of systems.

Simple in production methods:

> Dilbert was designed from the start to be simple to create, and I continue to streamline the process. (0)

Simple in execution:

> Human nature is such that we're good at following simple systems and not so good at following complicated systems.

> Simple systems are probably the best way to achieve success. Once you have success, optimizing begins to have more value.

Simple as an outcome:

> Simplicity is a worthy long-term goal. That's how you will free your personal energy so you can concentrate it where you need it.

> business writing is all about getting to the point and leaving out all of the noise.






## On Percieved Complexity

> One of the biggest obstacles to success--and a real energy killer--is the fear that you don't know how to do the stuff that your ideal career plans would require.

> You might think a topic is too complicated to master for your use, but you might learn otherwise in less than a minute if you bother to check.

> so it has been with about 90 percent of the topics that have intimidated me throughout my career. When you start asking questions, you often discover that there's a simple solution








# On Attitude

> You do better work, and you more enjoy life, when your attitude is good.

> I define an asshole as anyone who chooses to make the lives of others less pleasant for reasons that don't appear productive or necessary.

> Good health and sufficient money are necessary for a base level of happiness, but you need to be right with your family, friends, and romantic partners to truly enjoy life.

> manage your attitude is by understanding your basic nature as a moist robot that can be programmed for happiness if you understand the user interface.

> If you learn to control your ego, you can pick strategies that scare off the people who fear embarrassment

> Smiling makes you feel better even if your smile is fake. This is the clearest example of how your brain has a user interface.

> you shouldn't hesitate to modify your perceptions to whatever makes you happy, because you're probably wrong about the underlying nature of reality anyway.

> hope has a lot of practical utility.

> I motivate myself to take on a task this large (writing a book) is by imagining that I have fascinating and useful things to say that will help people... I choose to imagine that the book will do well because that illusion is highly motivating. It increases my energy.




## On Big Projects

> if you have a big, interesting project in the works, you're a winner every time you wake up.

> every one of my ideas had real-world potential, even if the odds were bad.

> see your big-idea projects as part of a system to improve your energy, contacts, and skills.





## Specialize In Something (How to Decide what)

> A great strategy for success in life is to become good at something, anything, and let that feeling propel you to new and better victories.

> Consider what you were obsessively doing before you were ten years old.

> Things that will someday work out well start out well... Small successes can grow into big ones, but failures rarely grow into successes.

> There's no denying the importance of practice. The hard part is figuring out what to practice... craft a life plan for yourself that embraces your natural inclinations, assuming you're not a cannibal.

> Practice involves putting your consciousness in suspended animation. Practicing is not living.

If you tolerate risk in order to do it, there's a good chance you really love it:

> Where there is a tolerance for risk, there is often talent.... I was willing to take a significant personal risk for my so-called art, and this was in sharp contrast to my otherwise risk-averse lifestyle.




## On Feedback and Critizism

Look for consistency between fans and critics. This is how he decided to make Dilbert office themed.

> ...noticed a consistent theme that held for both the fans and the haters

> Until then I'd relied on the opinions of friends and business associates, and that had limited value because that group of folks rarely offered criticism... Don't be fooled by the opinions of friends and family. They're all liars.

> It's generally true that if no one is excited about your art/product/idea in the beginning, they never will be.

> the thing that predicted Dilbert's success in year one is that it quickly gained a small but enthusiastic following... When the x factor is present, the public--or some subset of the public--picks up on it right away.

> Quality is one of the luxuries you can afford when the marketplace is spraying money in your direction and you have time to tinker.

Measure feedback by observing whether people do something active with your creation: 

> a good test of potential is whether people stick the comic to the refrigerator, tweet it, e-mail it to friends, put it on a blog page, or do anything else active.

> Persistence is useful, but there's no point in being an idiot about it.

> If your work inspires some excitement and some action from customers, get ready to chew through some walls. You might have something worth fighting for.





## Skillz

Simply: diversify.

> When it comes to skills, quantity often beats quality.

> Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success... You can raise your market value by being merely good--not extraordinary--at more than one skill.

> learning multiple skills makes your odds of success dramatically higher than learning one skill.
 
> you're better off being good at two complementary skills than being excellent at one.

> acquire as many of those key skills as possible, including public speaking, business writing, a working understanding of the psychology of persuasion, an understanding of basic technology concepts, social skills, proper voice technique, good grammar, and basic accounting. 

> If you think extraordinary talent and a maniacal pursuit of excellence are necessary for success, I say that's just one approach, and probably the hardest.

> None of my skills are world-class, but when my mediocre skills are combined, they become a powerful market force.

> Everything you learn becomes a shortcut for understanding something else.

> Every time we add new skills and broaden our network of contacts, our market value increases.

> Avoid career traps such as pursuing jobs that require you to sell your limited supply of time while preparing you for nothing better.





## Understand Pyschology, particularly Persuasion

> just about everything I learn about human psychology ends up being helpful.

> On a scale of one to ten, the importance of understanding psychology is a solid ten.

> you can benefit from a deeper understanding of how the mind interprets its world

> You can't get away from the need to make decisions based on psychology.

> the skills and insights I gleaned from studying hypnosis have improved my performance in just about everything I've done since then

> reason is just one of the drivers of our decisions, and often the smallest one.

> It is tremendously useful to know when people are using reason and when they are rationalizing

> If your view of the world is that people use reason for their important decisions, you are setting yourself up for a life of frustration and confusion. You'll find yourself continually debating people and never winning except in your own mind.

> Few things are as destructive and limiting as a worldview that assumes people are mostly rational.





## Comparisons

> If I were to disguise my identity and launch a new workplace comic tomorrow, with all new characters, readers would compare it with Dilbert and it wouldn't stand a chance.

> Quality is not an independent force in the universe; it depends on what you choose as your frame of reference.








## Socializing

> faking social confidence leads to the real thing over time.

> Adults are starved for a kind word... decent respect to humanity insists you voice your praise.

> laughably simple and 100 percent effective. All you do is introduce yourself and ask questions until you find a point of mutual interest.

> Ask questions. Don't complain (much). Don't talk about boring experiences (TV show, meal, dream, etc.). Don't dominate the conversation. Let others talk. Don't get stuck on a topic. Keep moving. Planning is useful but it isn't conversation. Keep the sad stories short, especially medical stories.

> The point of conversation is to make the other person feel good.

> figure out which people are thing people and which ones are people people.

> People are predisposed to liking attractive people. Talking can only make things worse.

> Observe outgoing people and steal their little tricks if you can. I've been doing that for years. It works great.

> Learn how to make small talk with strangers, and learn how to avoid being an asshole. If you get that stuff right--and almost anyone can--you will be hard to stop.

> Smile, ask questions, avoid complaining and sad topics, and have some entertaining stories ready to go. It's all you need to be in the top 10 percent of all conversationalists.


## Storytelling

> take your conversation skills up a notch. And that means becoming the master of short but interesting stories... I reflexively translate whatever I observe into a story form with a setup, a twist if there is one, and some sort of punch line or thought that ties it in a bow.

> imagine telling the story to someone in particular--a spouse, friend, or relative... storytelling is a learnable skill and not a genetic gift... If something story-worthy happens to you, spend some time developing the story structure in your head.

> Try to keep your setup to one sentence, two at most... [A] brief character profile is essential to any story that involves people... All good stories are about personalities.


## On Persuasion

> it might feel creepy and manipulative if you find yourself too skilled at persuasion. (0)

> favorite persuasion words, based on my own experiences:

* Because
* Would you mind ... ?
* I'm not interested.
* I don't do that.
* I have a rule ...
* I just wanted to clarify ...
* Is there anything you can do for me?
* This is just between you and me.

> No one can say why a thing holds interest for some and not for others. There's no argument against a lack of interest

> You might be surprised how effective this method is. I've been using it for years. It's a total conversation killer.

> most people will be happy to "clarify," even if the clarification is a complete reversal of an earlier position.

> Helping nice people always feels good. All you need to do is be polite and ask a direct question: "Is there anything you can do for me?" You'll be amazed how well it works.

> Any thank-you is better than none, but you're missing an opportunity if you do a poor job of it.

> If you can deliver an image of decisiveness, no matter how disingenuous, others will see it as leadership... Don't confuse your artificial sense of decisiveness with a need to be right all of the time.

> In any kind of negotiation, the worst thing you can do is act reasonable. Reasonable people generally cave in to irrational people because it seems like the path of least resistance.

> If you see persuasion as a form of manipulation, and you see manipulation as a form of evil, that worldview will keep you from being as persuasive as you might be.

> It's important to keep a lot of distance between your fun voice and your persuasive voice.

> the business world is a lot like theater.

> I think my fake professional voice and body language were at least half of the reason I was seen as having management potential.

> when I know a topic is likely to come up in the near future, I practice entire conversations in my head until I can speak my thoughts fluently.

> The holy grail of civilization is to someday make all people successful by discovering the formula used by successful people and making it available to all.

Things which lead to success:

* Lack of fear of embarrassment
* Education (the right kind)
* Exercise

> if you can't handle the risk of embarrassment, rejection, and failure, you need to learn how, and studies suggest that is indeed a learnable skill.

> Do you know what the unemployment rate is for engineers? It is nearly zero. Do you know how many engineers like their jobs? Most of them do, despite what you read in Dilbert comics.

> Education and psychological bravery are somewhat interchangeable. If you don't have much of one, you can compensate with a lot of the other. When you see a successful person who lacks a college education, you're usually looking at someone with an unusual lack of fear.

## About Humor

> Take it from me when I say a good sense of humor can compensate for a lot of other shortcomings

> dry humor is the best strategy if you plan to go for quantity.

> Funny complaints can wear people out.

> The only people who appreciate puns are the people who can do them. It's like water polo; it's hard to appreciate the sport unless you've played it.

> Humor temporarily shuts down the commonsense program in your moist robot brain and boots the random idea generator.

> it is my preference to be open-minded when I can manage it, so I went into it with the intention of giving it a fair try.

## Luck

> The success of Dilbert is mostly a story of luck. But I did make it easier for luck to find me, and I was thoroughly prepared when it did.

> see the world as a slot machine that doesn't ask you to put money in. All it asks is your time, focus, and energy




## Happiness and Mood Altering

> find the people who most represent what you would like to become and spend as much time with them as you can without trespassing, kidnapping, or stalking.

> you can change your chemistry by drinking alcohol or doing recreational drugs. The problem with each of those methods is that it comes with risks and side effects you'd rather avoid.

> the single biggest trick for manipulating your happiness chemistry is being able to do what you want, when you want.

> It's important to look at happiness in terms of timing because timing is easier to control than resources.

> A person with a flexible schedule and average resources will be happier than a rich person who has everything except a flexible schedule.

> I've transformed work into pleasure simply by having control over when I do it.

> find a boss who values your productivity over your attendance.

> Happiness is the only useful goal in life. Unless you are a sociopath, your own happiness will depend on being good to others.

> happiness tends to happen naturally whenever you have good health, resources, and a flexible schedule.

> Happiness has more to do with where you're heading than where you are.

> have a sport or hobby that leaves you plenty of room to improve every year.

> Pessimism is often a failure of imagination... daydream that the future will be better than today, by far.

> Happiness is the natural state for most people whenever they feel healthy, have flexible schedules, and expect the future to be good.

> Just add pessimism and cynicism to any observation and you can manufacture bad news out of thin air.

> the primary culprit in your bad moods is a deficit in one of the big five: flexible schedule, imagination, sleep, diet, and exercise.

> the formula for happiness is as simple as daydreaming, controlling your schedule, napping, eating right, and being active every day.

> When you're fit, happy, and full of energy, people are far more likely to have sex with you, be your friend, and hire you, sometimes all in the same day.

> I had the precise job I had wanted since childhood. I was officially rich. I was as famous as I wanted to be. And I was suddenly and profoundly sad.

> Recapping the happiness formula: Eat right. Exercise. Get enough sleep. Imagine an incredible future (even if you don't believe it). Work toward a flexible schedule. Do things you can steadily improve at. Help others (if you've already helped yourself). Reduce daily decisions to routine. (0)

## Food

> I've successfully erased cravings for a wide variety of less-healthy foods. I do them one at a time, and it's a lot easier than you might think.

> Whenever it's practical and safe, consider your body a laboratory in which you can test different approaches to health.

> I literally use white rice like a sleeping pill on evenings when I've had too much coffee.

> The main point for both diet and exercise is that you want to reduce the amount of willpower required. Any other approach is unsustainable... An attractive alternative makes willpower less necessary. It frees up your stockpile of willpower for other uses.

> I see Diet Coke as a weird little colored water full of chemicals that I don't need.

> Nutrition science is shockingly incomplete... [it] presents itself as science but is perhaps 60 percent bullshit, guessing, bad assumptions, and marketing.

> We citizens can only watch the show and use our bullshit filters as best we can.

> Laziness can make you choose healthy foods if you are clever enough to make those foods the most convenient in your house.


## Fitness

> Simplification is often the difference between doing something you know you should do and putting it off.

> I have condensed the entire field of fitness advice into one sentence: Be Active Every Day

> The right amount of exercise today is whatever amount makes me look forward to being active tomorrow.

> Most normal adults, including me, find running to be little more than the most cost-effective way to be bored and uncomfortable.
