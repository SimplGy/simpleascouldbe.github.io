title:  "About Me"
---


I'm Eric Miller. I build software, particularly web applications. I have a background in design and am self taught in programming.
I try to stay balanced between froofy art stuff and elite nerd things.
I belive the best way to make successful software is to *build something people want* and make it *insanely simple to use*.

Simple == Usable
----------------------------------------
Working for Epic gave me the opportunity to talk with lots of real, clinical end users.
These weren't computer people -- some of them didn't differentiate between left and right clicks, for example.
But they were brilliant people -- radiologists, surgeons, experienced nurses, CRNAs, and so on.

I talked with clinicians to figure out how to make the software they use better. I needed to understand what features they like and dodn't like.
One of my favorite questions to get specific is to ask what things really *annoyed* them.
I think people like being able to talk candidly with someone who works for the company that made the software they're using.
Hearing complaints about software always reads like opportunity to me.
Lots of the problems people have with software are tiny, tiny fixes in terms of development effort--they just involve asking a representative end user how they think about a workflow.

When I would ask end users about features they like, I started to notice a trend in the way they would describe it.
They would often start with something like,
"I really like this, it's just so *simple*".
Substitute "not complicated", "easy", "intuitive"--it all meant the same thing to them.
I would drill deeper with my questions: "How does it help you get this task done?"
And they would explain how it fit their workflow needs directly and without extra steps.

I came to recognize that *a user calling your software "simple" is the highest compliment*.
It doesn't mean the software lacks features, in fact, some of the workflows described as simple were amazingly powerful.
It means that your software fits the goal the user is trying to accomplish so easily and transparently that almost no thought is required of them.
For clinicians, and, I'd say, for any user, that's what you want. *People don't want to think about software, they want to get things done*.

I've done usability, design, and development for years now, and I believe that the software folks like best is the software that is blindingly simple to use.

I think that even simple to use software can help people accomplish things that seem like science fiction.

Quotes
------
Albert Einstein:
> "As simple as possible, but no simpler"

Steve Jobs:
> "That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."


Principles
----------

* "Wow, that was easy" is the highest praise.
* End Users Know Best (Talk to 'normal' people, not n3rds)
