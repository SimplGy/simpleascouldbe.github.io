A book by Ken Ilgunas. Awesome descriptions of leaving it all behind. Very honest narrative. Not much practical stuff about actual van life, but that's not what this story is.

## Selected Excerpts

> Remember who you wanted to be. — BUMPER STICKER ON VOLVO IN THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT

> Every day I could feel my “horizons expanding,” as they say. I was writing and speaking more clearly. I began having new ideas and asking new questions. College, for the first time, felt like a place where I belonged.

> College had helped me see how everything, for my whole life, had either been predetermined or planned out: I went to high school because I was forced to; I went to college because I was supposed to; and now I’d enter Career World because I was financially obligated to.

> I grew up thinking it was normal for a married couple to never sit on the same couch, hug each other, or demonstrate even the vaguest expression of intimacy.

> Every year I was getting more and more into debt and becoming less and less free.

> I wanted to drive to Alaska more than anything in the goddamned world. And getting there, as far as I was concerned, was my life’s purpose, my dream of dreams, my ultimate adventure.

> I once heard that we are nothing but our stories. Forget the blood and bones and genes and cells. They’re not what we are. We are, rather, our stories.

> Counter her seriousness with playfulness, her pessimism with optimism, her insanity with inanity.

> There are 365,000 cashiers and 318,000 waiters and waitresses in America who have bachelor’s degrees, as do one-fifth of those working in the retail industry.

> More than 100,000 college graduates are janitors and 18,000 push carts. (There are 5,057 janitors in the United States who have doctorates and professional degrees!)

> Our complaints are often just thinly veiled boasts about how busy our lives are, as if having no time for leisure, for a good night’s sleep, or to do the things we actually want to do is some virtuous sacrifice we should all strive to make.

> The cabins—made of stacked birch logs—are still standing from Wiseman’s boomtown days. They are crowded by raspberry bushes or giant clusters of blue delphiniums.

> Jack Reakoff was in his late forties, yet he didn’t look a day older than thirty-five. He had a sturdy, frontiersman’s carriage, and wore a necklace made of wolf teeth and a belt buckle made of Dall sheep horn.

> At the end of each rafting trip, I’d pretend that docking the raft was a hazardous, life-threatening undertaking. When docking it, I’d always make sure I got wet, sometimes even submerging my whole body underwater. “Everybody hold on!” I’d yell, as we approached the bank. “This might get a bit tricky.”

> They’d get inebriated after work, beat each other up, and kick each other’s doors in (which, conveniently, they were able to repair).
