  options and objects:
    startYear: What year should the timeline start in?
    timelineHeight: px height of timeline. Given startYear, this determines the pixel height of years and months -- the timeline always runs up until `now`.
    title: The title of the events column
    width: override for different proportions of columns. This sets a flex basis and works with % or px
    events: Each event object MUST have a name, to, and from, specified in YYYY-MM-DD format for Jekyll, although the timeline only handles granularity down to a month.
            You may optionally include a description. name and description are parsed as markdown so you may include links and basic formatting.
