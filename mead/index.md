## Mead & Cider

I make mead sometimes.

Originally, it was honey, apples, and no funny business. But lately I wanted it to taste good in less time so I've started playing around with staggered nutrient addition and additives. Goal is apple+honey flavor, slightly more sweet than "off-dry", preserving apple and honey notes.

Here's a tracking sheet with details for each batch (if I've kept it up to date):
