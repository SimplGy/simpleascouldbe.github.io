## To-Do

### ðŸ”¬ On Deck

```
- [ ] Fix article styling, it's actually in kind of bad shape (block quotes, bullet points with paragraphs in them)
- [ ] Make the main nav work on mobile (doesn't fit)
- [ ] Use an img while the video is loading
- [ ] Fix video origin, see if it can work on mobile
```

### ðŸŒˆ Some Day

```
- [ ] consider https://github.com/poole/poole
- [ ] Click responsiveness and IxN on mobile and tablet
- [ ] See if there's a way to get reddit, google+, instapaper, and other post-parsers to see the banner image first. Otherwise they share the first content image (hide an `img` tag in the banner?)
- [ ] Show discussion on related sites, either by manually listing which Reddit/Hacker News threads are discussing it or by detecting them automatically.
- [ ] Redo fonts with https://femmebot.github.io/google-type
- [ ] Move all van posts over from winterpress to here
```
