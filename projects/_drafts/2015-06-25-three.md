## Features

* Beautiful, full-screen visual timer
* Three separate time scales: 2, 10, and 60 minutes
* Tap to see remaining time, otherwise, just a subtle, intuitive, shape-based display
* Great responsive feel when dragging this timer up and down, like moving a pool of ferrous material
* Timer rings with peaceful bird chirping sounds sampled from Thailand
* Screen flashes while ringing as a fallback in case volume is off. The screen flashes match audio levels.

## Animation

Because this app is pretty flat, a lot of its beauty is about smooth, fluid animation. It's hard to show that in a gif with low frame rate, so here's a video:

## Notes

I was motivated to try my first swift app because the timing seemed right (Swift just released) and I didn't have any full-time clients. I also had just made a friend in Chiang Mai who really knew what he was doing on mobile so I thought it'd be awesome to have both that additional shared interest and someone to ask questions when I got stuck.

It was just a toy, but I wanted to release something, so I bet my girlfriend $100 I'd submit it to the app store by my birthday.

With that motivation in place, I knew I had to pick something small in scope. I thought "A timer! that's so easy! I'll just put a unique spin on it and be done in a few days."

Little did I know that building a long-running timer in iOS is one of the most difficult things you can do for reasons that aren't immediately obvious. If it's going to ring an hour from now, you need all kinds of permissions from the user, and even then if their volume is off there's nothing you can do about it. This is challenging because it's just not the expectation people have when coming from the Apple timer. It works with volume off, when locked, with no extra permissions.

## Challenges

* What if the sound is turned off? Then that neat thing you wrote to strobe the screen in time with audio peaks also doesn't flash
* What if they background you and the app gets collected AND they haven't given you notification permissions?
* What if they only give you sound notification permissions (not banner) and they have their sound off?
* Combinatorics: You set a notification so it can ring in the background even if your app is closed. What if your app is still running in the bg and then the notification goes?t
