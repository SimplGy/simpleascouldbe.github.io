title: Howl - Visual Story Telling
---

*Howl* is a poem by Allen Ginsberg. This is a student project featuring a fictional cover and spread designed for the magazine *The Manipulator*

We recreated the poem on scraps of paper and ink handwriting. All of these props are real and all of the images are unaltered apart from basic retouching. The surreal nature of the photographs comes from a special long exposure lighting technique.

I was a collaborator on this project on the concept of design by physical layout, creation and collection of props, and production.
