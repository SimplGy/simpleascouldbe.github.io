This was the first large JavaScript application I was primarily responsible for building.

It replaced a legacy system for helping hospitals manage their medical devices.

A given hospital might have `100`-`10,000` medical devices, all of which have to monitored and configured.

This was implemented as a desktop and web-based iPad application using Backbone and RequireJS.

Because this application was a regulated medical device, there was also extreme focus on unit and acceptance tests, and QUnit was used for this.

It was 2013, Backbone was hot, and we wanted this app to have it all. There were dashboards:

There were network maps:

I payed a lot of attention to nitty-gritty details:

![login](/projects/img/dcx/2012-i-pad2.jpg)

And so, so much wireframing:

In the end, we launched a fast, pretty app that helped our customers and learned a lot in the process.

## Side note: Scale

This was part of a fairly large application. Additionally, it was structured from the beginning to share functionality common to multiple apps with Require JS modules.

I'm not a big line of code counter, but what's interesting looking back is that about 95% of this JavaScript (3k/64k) was at least theoretically reusable across apps.

The core application codebase:

```

The common reusable components codebase (leveraged by the core app):
