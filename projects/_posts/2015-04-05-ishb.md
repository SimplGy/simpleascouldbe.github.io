There is, I think, a healthy rebellion in the works against server-heavy CMS applications.

A platform like WordPress can deliver a lot of business value, but it turns out much of what it does (categorization, tagging, cross-post linking, visualizing structured data) can be done at dev time instead of at run time.

If you can build an entire site at dev time this is a tremendous advantage, because you can:

* Deploy easily to almost any platform
* Scale horizontally almost for free
* Put everything on edge cached CDNs
* Skip all the markup, css, and js bloat of a traditional CMS

The end result is a web site that has incredibly fast end-user response times, while keeping the primary functionality of a traditional corporate/marketing/blog site.
 
I'd played a bit with [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) and Jekyll before taking on the ISHB project, so I thought it'd be a great opportunity to do a real-world project with Jekyll.

The result was a fast, light, and maintainable website for the ISHB team.
