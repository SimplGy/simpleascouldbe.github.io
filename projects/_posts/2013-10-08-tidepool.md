I built a few different mini-games while working at TidePool. They all used the same technology stack.   

The output of these games were validated by psychologists and data scientists to correlate with standard tests.

The goal was to create a simpler and more enjoyable way for people to learn about themselves.

This first game, pictured above, was about picking symbols and words that resonate with you. The artificial time constraint created by the shapes flowing past you generated more honest, gut-level responses.

Another game allowed the user to size and reposition circles representing different personality traits. Personality traits that the user felt more affinity towards were larger and closer to their avatar.

I built mobile versions of these games too. Some were just responsive/css changes and others had to be entirely separate JavaScript modules:
