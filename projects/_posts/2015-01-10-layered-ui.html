Floaty was an abstraction built to manage layers in the UI.

This component manages the depth and dismissibility behavior of other layered elements, leaving a clean API for the end-developer.

This included tooltips, drop downs, modals, and popovers.

By using a central abstraction, challenges like "dismiss the topmost floating element when the background is clicked" become very straightforward.

It is implemented for an Angular app as a resuable set directives and factory methods. It allows the developer to create tooltips, toggle-able panels,
and modals of N depth without requiring knowledge of the other layered elements being used at the application at that time.
