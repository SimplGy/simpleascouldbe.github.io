This records API responses so you can play them back later, quickly and reliably.

If you're a front-end developer this means you can develop without an API server--even without the internet.

You can also write tests for front end components that have some API dependencies but shouldn't break if the API server has hiccups.

This is a node app with no database dependency. It's easy to integrate with `grunt` or `gulp`, or use from the command line.

It's good for:

* **Testing** (Responses are always the same, and fast)
* **Nomads** (Work on JS apps without internet)
* **Unstable APIs** (the VCR smooths out API downtimes)
* **Throttled APIs** (don't get shut down for querying too much while developing)
* **Coordinating** with frequent back end changes that require 30 minutes of API downtime to rebuild and deploy (ahem).

## How it Works

For each request, the VCR will create a single JSON file organized using the request information.

For example, the request:

    GET http://foo.com:42/users/1
    
Is mapped to the folder and file:

    ./api-vcr-data/foo.com/42/users/1.json

This works by standing up a server in between your app and your API. If you have control over your app's API url, it's easy--just point it to `api-vcr` instead.

If you have multiple API servers, no problem. You stand up an instance of the vcr for each one. Each VCR will have a different port so you set them up as different urls in your app, just like you're probably already doing.

If you do not have control over the API server being requested (if you're using library code, for example), you can modify your `etc/hosts` file to accomplish the same flow. I'm thinking about a script to make this easier, but I have some security concerns and I'm not sure about the design. I don't want to mess up anybody's system.

Whenever you make reqeuests to api-vcr in `--record` mode, it passes the request on to your destination api server and records the response. You can see JSON files for your recorded responses in finder any time:
