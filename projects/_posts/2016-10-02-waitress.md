Waitress is a new way to order and pay at some of the best restaurants in Stockholm.

It was also my first commercial iOS app, and was done entirely in swift.

We rode the crest of the wave on some of the betas, including a painful experience with Xcode beta 8 where I got to discover (and [report](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2335)) some bleeding edge [language issues](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2312).

One of the features I'm most proud of is this custom animation for order progress. We were seeing issues where people would go to the restaurant too soon, or not understand all the steps in the process.

I designed and implemented this custom animation to make the order progression clear:

Other problems solved:

* Currency localization, display, and math (bankers rounding, etc)
* Custom stepped, animated progress display
* Programmatically colored icon images
* Combined table and map views with mode switching
* Animating, customized tab bar badge
* Payment integration

Discounts and credits interacted in a precise way and needed to look slick:

And menu items have many choices, and rules about those choices:

Tipping in Sweden is interesting. Instead of a flat percentage, they "round up" to the nearest value, an increment that varies based on the amount of the check.

I came up with an algorithm that approximates this and fills in a nice default value for the user:
