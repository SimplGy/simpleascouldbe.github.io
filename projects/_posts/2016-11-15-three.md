## Origin Story

My first iOS app, I started this project right after Swift was announced.

Learning was my main objective but I also thought it'd be neat to at least try to sell it. I'd never done that before, so as incentive I told my girlfriend I'd give her $100
if I didn't submit it to the app store on deadline.

While learning, I saw a lot of tutorials about building timers. Seemed like a good starter project. I just needed a fresh approach to keep me interested in the app.

It bothers me that phones, microwaves, and other digital timers aren't as easy as the classic twist-and-release kitchen timer. Kitchen timers are great--there's only one UI element
and they're versatile enough to use for 1-2 minute precision at any range between few minutes minutes and a few hours.

I first thought of making a direct, even skeuomorphic copy of a kitchen timer, but I just couldn't imagine twisting or dragging in a circle working naturally on a touch device.
Instead I came up with the idea of using the whole screen as the UI, where a full screen represented `100%` of the timer and `0%` meant the timer was done -- sort of like a health bar in a video game.

Finally, a ringing timer is usually annoying. I don't think that's necessary. It's enough for them to stand out from your aural environment -- why not make them pleasant?
That's where the bird sounds came from. I was in Chiang Mai at the time so I used sounds from that region.



## Surprisingly Difficult

Little did I know that building a long-running timer in iOS is actually pretty difficult for reasons that weren't immediately obvious to me.

If you set a timer that's going to ring an hour from now, you need all kinds of permissions from the user.
Even if you have those, if their volume is off there's nothing you can do about it (EDIT: there may be a solution for this. If you know it, please share).

This is challenging because it's just not the expectation people have when coming from the Apple timer. The system timer works with volume off, when locked, with no extra permissions -- that's tough to beat.

Think about these scenarios:

* The app could be in foreground, background, or closed -- the timer should always ring at the right time
* The phone can be in silent mode, with low volume, or no volume -- the timer should still raise as much of an alert as it thinks the user wishes
* The user might not believe a timer app has a legitimate use for notification permissions
* The user may have granted the app any combination of permissions for sound notifications, banner notifications, or background refresh -- the app should do its best in each scenario

Handling all the combinations of these scenarios while trying to strike a balance between annoying and informing the user makes this pretty tough to handle.

I ended up with a heuristic that warns every so often when the user sets a long-running timer if we do not have permissions unless they denied permissions explicitly more than N times.
If permissions have been denied more than a threshold, I warn even less often with something like "Hey, just so you know, this won't work if you change to a different app, because you haven't given me permission".



## Outcome

I'm pretty happy with the aesthetics of the result. The dragging and flinging animation is fluid in a way no web application has ever been for me.

One problem I had is you lose the granularity and visibility of a kitchen timer at small time scales.
My solution was to split into different time scales of 2, 10 and 60 minutes. This is where the app gets its name.

I do wonder if instead of simply mapping time into linear pixel space I would have worked nicely to dynamically adjust the input scale for small numbers. Maybe v2 :)

Thanks for reading.
