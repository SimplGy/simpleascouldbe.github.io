## Why Build This?

I use emojis at work as status/category icons to dress up spreadsheets and docs.

Finding emojis on a desktop device is a little challenging. I love [mojibar](https://github.com/muan/mojibar) for Mac, but needed a cross-platform way to do the same thing.

I thought a Chrome Extension would be great solution, but when I looked at the most popular emoji keyboards, they either:

* ðŸ¤® Use images instead of real unicode emojis (yuck)
* â˜  Require permission to "read and change data on all sites you visit" (danger!)

So, I built this Chrome Extension:

## Why is it Better?

My extension only asks for clipboard access, which is probably the minimum you can ask for and still provide a useful/seamless emoji finding experience.

I spent some time getting the keyboard to work well, so both the arrow keys and tab work well to navigate and select emoji.

## How Can I Get it?

Get it on the Chrome Webstore, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emoji-magic/jfegjdogmpipkpmapflkkjpkhbnfppln).
