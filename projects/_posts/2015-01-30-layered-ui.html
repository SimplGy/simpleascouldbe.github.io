  This component manages the depth and dismissibility behavior of other layered elements, leaving a clean API for the end-developer.

  It is implemented for an Angular app as a resuable set directives and factory methods. It allows the developer to create tooltips, toggle-able panels,
  and modals of N depth without requiring knowledge of the other layered elements being used at the application at that time.
