# To-Do

A to-do list for this project.

## Today
x Use nested layouts so I don't have to repeat the HTML boilerplate -- boilerplate < landing/default < post
x Useable footer
x Get rid of php
x Snippet to display a post summary (title, metadata, a few lines). minimal styling
o Basic styling for a blog permalink page (type leads, link to next post)
o Get `books/fail-at-everything` up
o Get any other blog post up
o page that lists all posts and a `blog` link to it

## Later
o Move all van posts over from winterpress to here
o Hover/animation/IxN so that `simple guy` and `Eric Miller` interchange
