## Features

* Full-screen timer you can see from across the room.
* Three separate time scales so you can set a timer for any task.
* No ticking numbers unless you want them. Tap to see remaining time.
* Peaceful bird chirping sounds when the timer rings.
* Screen flashes when the timer rings so you can use it without sound.

## How Does it Work?

You can drag up or down anywhere on the screen to set the timer where you'd like. When you release, the timer starts running.
