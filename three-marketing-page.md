## Features

* Beautiful, full-screen visual timer
* Three separate time scales: 2, 10, and 60 minutes
* Subtle, intuitive, shape-based display. Tap to see remaining time.
* Great responsive feel when interacting, like moving a pool of ferrous material
* Timer rings with peaceful bird chirping sounds
* Screen flashes while ringing as a fallback in case volume is off.
