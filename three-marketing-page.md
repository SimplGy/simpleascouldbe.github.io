## Features

* Full-screen timer you can see from across the room.
* Three separate time scales so you can set a timer for any task.
* No ticking numbers unless you want them. Tap to see remaining time.
* Peaceful bird chirping sounds when the timer rings.
* Screen flashes when the timer rings so you can use it without sound.

## How Does it Work?

You can drag up or down anywhere on the screen to set the timer where you'd like. When you release, the timer starts running.

If you want a different time granularity, swipe left or right to change.
