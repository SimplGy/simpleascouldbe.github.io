# To-Do

A to-do list for this project.

## Today

## On Deck
o Fix video origin, see if it can work on mobile
o Use an img while the video is loading, and play seamlessly from there
o Support code highlighting with normal triple-backtick code blocks instead of boo `% highlight js %` stuff
o consider https://github.com/poole/poole
o redo colors using http://www.rocket-design.fr/color-template/
o Better fit on mobile and tablet (footer, reduce global padding/margins)
o Click responsiveness and IxN on mobile and tablet (aim for perfect on ipad air)

## Over the Rainbow
o Pick a color scheme I can live with for a while. Main color (green), supporting color (blue?), background color (not quite white), shaded bg color (pale white), dark (not quite black, tinged brown), etc.
o Style blockquotes nicely
o Style lists in markdown posts nicely
o Move all van posts over from winterpress to here
o Handle loading smoothly (load flat images in dom order. Then load videos based on scroll position. Play videos only when the user is viewing that one)
