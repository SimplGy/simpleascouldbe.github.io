# To-Do

A to-do list for this project.

## Today
x Point to geoblocked CDN for projects
x If the img fails to load, remove the containing element
x Improve copy for project titles
x Hover/animation/IxN so that `simple guy` and `Eric Miller` interchange

## On Deck
o Better fit on mobile and tablet (footer, reduce global padding/margins)
o Click responsiveness and IxN on mobile and tablet (aim for perfect on ipad air)

## Over the Rainbow
o Pick a color scheme I can live with for a while. Main color (green), supporting color (blue?), background color (not quite white), shaded bg color (pale white), dark (not quite black, tinged brown), etc.
o Style blockquotes nicely
o Style lists in markdown posts nicely
o Move all van posts over from winterpress to here
o Handle loading smoothly (load flat images in dom order. Then load videos based on scroll position. Play videos only when the user is viewing that one)


## Done
x MvP design for a project summary with: list of code snippets, short description, technology bullet points
x Implement design
x Write good content for descriptions
x fix flexbox for safari
x Improve IxN For project details (hover to hint, click or hover for deets)
x Adjust `typePretty` for new font
x Carefully select and make available **awesome** code snippets
x Get project page working against posts
x footer with programatically generated gh-page references for organization
x show loader while gifs are coming in
x List all projects
x Include gif or image for each project
